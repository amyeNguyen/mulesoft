It promotes agility by enabling rapid, controlled changes to specific layers without impacting the whole system MuleSoft's API-led connectivity uses a three-tier architecture (Experience, Process, and System layers). This approach promotes agility as changes can be made to a specific layer (e.g., Experience API) without necessarily affecting the other layers, thus facilitating rapid adjustments without major disruptions. Option A is incorrect. Hardcoding integrations would lead to inflexibility, which is opposite to what API-led connectivity aims to achieve. Option C is incorrect. The essence of API-led connectivity is to allow for granular, specific changes without needing to overhaul the entire integration. Option D is incorrect. API-led connectivity does not enforce a strict hierarchical communication system. Instead, it provides a modular framework that ensures organized communication across applications.
Question 33
A healthcare system allows doctors to upload patient medical records. Once uploaded, these records are processed and stored into the database. After each day, all the records are aggregated and sent to a central health repository. Meanwhile, as soon as a record is uploaded, a notification is sent to multiple departments, such as billing and patient care. Which interaction patterns describe this scenario?
Stream, batch, and multicast
Correct answer
One-way, batch, and multicast
Request-reply, stream, and multicast
One-way, stream, and batch
Overall explanation
Correct Answer: B. One-way, batch, and multicast When doctors upload patient medical records and they are processed and stored without immediate feedback, it resembles a one-way interaction pattern. The aggregation of records at the end of the day and sending them to a central repository is indicative of the batch pattern. Sending notifications to multiple departments upon record upload is representative of the multicast pattern. Option A is incorrect because the scenario doesn't mention real-time continuous data (stream). Option C is incorrect because there isn't a synchronous request-reply interaction, and streaming isn't mentioned. Option D is incorrect because, while it mentions stream and batch, it misses the multicast interaction.

Which delivery methodology is TechFusion using for this project?
Agile
Spiral
Correct answer
Waterfall
Kanban
Overall explanation
Correct Answer: C. Waterfall The Waterfall methodology follows a linear and sequential approach where each phase of a project must be completed before moving on to the next. It is characterized by distinct goals for each phase and does not allow for revisiting previous phases once they are completed. Option A is incorrect. Agile promotes iterative development and regular feedback, which contrasts with the strict sequential phases described in the scenario. Option B is incorrect. Spiral combines iterative development with systematic risk assessment. It allows phases to be revisited multiple times as the project progresses, contrary to the approach described.
