Which interaction patterns are being utilized by this system?
Correct answer
Stream, batch, and one-way
Request-reply, batch, and multicast
Stream, request-reply, and multicast
One-way, batch, and multicast
Overall explanation
Correct Answer: A. Stream, batch, and one-way The real-time tracking of songs played by users implies a continuous flow of data, which corresponds to the stream interaction pattern. The monthly compilation of top songs is an example of the batch interaction pattern. Artists receiving feedback about their songs, where the system is just sending out information without expecting any acknowledgment, aligns with the one-way pattern. Option B is incorrect because there’s no indication of a request-reply pattern in the scenario. Option C is incorrect since there’s no mention of the multicast or request-reply pattern. Option D is incorrect because while it correctly identifies batch, the real-time tracking of played songs is stream, not one-way.
Question 12
Your company uses a cloud-based CRM system and an on-premises ERP system.

FTP-based file transfer
Batch processing with nightly runs
Correct answer
Real-time streaming with a message broker
Direct API calls for each log entry
Overall explanation
Correct Answer: C. Real-time streaming with a message broker For high-volume, real-time data like logs, a message broker that supports real-time streaming is apt. It can handle large volumes of data, buffer it if necessary, and provide mechanisms to transform the diverse log formats into a standard one before sending them to the centralized system. Option A is incorrect. FTP-based file transfers are periodic and not designed for real-time data synchronization. Option B is incorrect. Batch processing with nightly runs would mean that logs are not centralized in real-time, leading to potential delays in detecting and responding to issues. Option D is incorrect. Direct API calls for each log entry would not efficiently handle the high volume of logs and might lead to rate limiting or other issues.
Question 19
A global e-commerce platform allows customers to order products from various vendors. When a customer places an order, the system gathers available inventory details from multiple vendors, calculates the overall best price (including shipping and taxes), and finally confirms the order with the selected vendor. Which composition pattern best describes this process?
Correct answer
Aggregation
Orchestration
Choreography
Decoupling
Overall explanation
Correct Answer: A. Aggregation The scenario describes a process where the system gathers responses from multiple services (vendors) and combines them to derive a result (best price) which is then presented to the client (order confirmation). This is an example of the aggregation composition pattern, where multiple responses are consolidated into a single one. Option B is incorrect. While orchestration involves a centralized approach where a single service/process directs others, the focus here is on collating responses, which aligns more with aggregation. Option C is incorrect. Choreography is a decentralized approach where services interact based on events without a central coordinator, which is not described in the scenario. Option D is incorrect. Decoupling is a design principle ensuring that components are independent but isn’t a composition pattern.
Question 20
James is testing a MuleSoft RESTful web service. When he sends a request to retrieve information about a specific product, the server sends a response indicating that the resource was not found. What HTTP Status Code is the server most likely using to indicate this?

Question 28
A weather monitoring system periodically collects data from different sensors placed in various regions. Every hour, this data is sent to a centralized server for analysis. Users can also query the server to get the current weather conditions for a specific region. When there is a prediction for severe weather, alerts are sent simultaneously to local authorities, news stations, and emergency services. Which interaction patterns does this system employ?
Stream, request-reply, and multicast
Correct answer
Batch, request-reply, and multicast
One-way, request-reply, and stream
Batch, one-way, and multicast
Overall explanation
Correct Answer: B. Batch, request-reply, and multicast Periodic data collection and sending it every hour for analysis is indicative of the batch interaction pattern. When users query the server for specific weather conditions and get a response, it represents the request-reply pattern. Sending severe weather alerts to multiple recipients (authorities, news, and emergency services) represents the multicast pattern. Option A is incorrect because there’s no continuous flow of data to represent the stream pattern in the given scenario. Option C is incorrect because the periodic collection of data is batch processing, not one-way or stream. Option D is incorrect since while it correctly identifies batch and multicast, it misses the request-reply pattern.
Question 29

Connectors facilitate integration with specific systems but don’t define API specifications.
Question 30
An e-commerce company is integrating its online platform with a third-party supplier to automate the ordering of low-stock items. The integration should ensure that when stock levels of a particular item drop below a certain threshold, an order is automatically placed with the supplier without manual intervention. Which approach is most suitable?
Periodic database dumps to the supplier
Correct answer
Event-driven architecture (EDA) with webhooks
Scheduled FTP file transfers
Direct database integration with the supplier's system
Overall explanation
Correct Answer: B. Event-driven architecture (EDA) with webhooks An event-driven approach ensures that when a specific event (in this case, stock levels dropping below a threshold) occurs, an action (ordering more stock) is immediately triggered. Webhooks can be used to notify the third-party supplier’s system in real-time. Option A is incorrect. Periodic database dumps would not ensure real-time ordering when stock reaches the defined threshold. Option C is incorrect. Scheduled FTP file transfers operate periodically and might result in delays in ordering low-stock items. Option D is incorrect. Direct database integration can lead to tight coupling and potential security risks.

HTTP Methods
Overall explanation
Correct Answer: C. HTTP Status Codes HTTP Status Codes are integral to the HTTP response and indicate the result of the HTTP request. They provide information about the success, failure, or other states of the request. For example, a status code of 200 indicates success, while a 404 indicates that the requested resource was not found. Option A is incorrect because HTTP Headers provide metadata about the request or response, not the status of the request itself. Option B is incorrect because the HTTP Body contains the actual data of the response, not the status information. Option D is incorrect because HTTP Methods (like GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) define the operation type but don’t provide status information about the request’s outcome.
