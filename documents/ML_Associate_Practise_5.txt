Question 35
A healthcare company needs to maintain electronic health records (EHR) for its patients. Due to strict healthcare regulations, they are required to store sensitive patient data within the country’s borders. However, for their global research partners, they need certain non-sensitive datasets available worldwide. Which deployment architecture should the company opt for to fulfill these requirements?
Pure Cloud Deployment
On-Premise Deployment
Correct answer
Hybrid Deployment
Decentralized Deployment
Overall explanation
Correct Answer: C. Hybrid Deployment The Hybrid Deployment allows an organization to keep specific sensitive data within their on-premise infrastructure (to comply with country-specific regulations) while making certain non-sensitive datasets available on the cloud for global accessibility. Option A is incorrect. Pure Cloud Deployment may not ensure that sensitive data remains within the country. Option B is incorrect. While On-Premise Deployment would keep data within the country, it won’t easily facilitate global data sharing. Option D is incorrect. Decentralized Deployment focuses more on distributing processes and functions rather than on specific data location constraints.
Question 36
A large e-commerce company is revamping its decade-old platform. They have a single codebase handling everything from user authentication, inventory management, payment processing, to shipment tracking. The company is finding it increasingly difficult to deploy changes, maintain stability, and onboard new developers. They are considering a shift in their application architecture. Which approach would be most suitable for them to address these challenges?
Migrate to a more modern monolithic architecture
Correct answer
Decompose the platform into microservices based on business capabilities
Adopt a hybrid model, combining both microservices and monolithic traits
Enhance the existing platform by adding more features to the monolith
Overall explanation
Correct Answer: B. Decompose the platform into microservices based on business capabilities Decomposing a monolithic application into microservices can offer greater flexibility, easier maintenance, individual scaling of components, and better onboarding for new developers since they can focus on a specific service instead of the entire monolithic codebase. Option A is incorrect. A modern monolithic architecture might still have the same challenges associated with a large, intertwined codebase. Option C is incorrect. While hybrid models can offer some benefits, the mentioned challenges are best addressed by a full transition to microservices. Option D is incorrect. Simply adding more features to the existing monolithic platform would exacerbate the existing challenges.
Question 37
Carlos, a CTO, wants to gain insight into the real-time API traffic within his organization. He wishes to analyze the performance, identify errors, and get detailed analytics of the APIs in deployment. Which component of the Anypoint Platform should Carlos leverage to achieve this?
Anypoint Runtime Manager
Anypoint Studio
Correct answer
Anypoint Monitoring
Anypoint Connector DevKit
Overall explanation
Correct Answer: C. Anypoint Monitoring Anypoint Monitoring provides advanced monitoring capabilities for Mule applications and APIs. It gives real-time visibility into API performance, errors, and detailed analytics, enabling organizations to proactively address issues and improve API efficiency. Option A is incorrect. While Anypoint Runtime Manager provides capabilities to deploy, manage, and monitor APIs, it does not offer the advanced monitoring and analytics features that Carlos needs. Option B is incorrect. Anypoint Studio is primarily an integrated development environment for building Mule applications and APIs. It does not provide real-time API monitoring features. Option D is incorrect. Anypoint Connector DevKit is used to develop connectors and does not provide monitoring capabilities.
Question 38
A large multinational company is planning to modernize its IT landscape. While they have various legacy systems in place, they’re also adopting cloud-based solutions. They want an approach that allows components to be reused, ensuring flexibility and rapid development. Which integration approach might they find limiting due to potential lack of reusability?
Event-Driven Architecture (EDA)
Correct answer
Point-to-Point Integration
API-led Connectivity
Microservices Architecture
Overall explanation
Correct Answer: B. Point-to-Point Integration Point-to-Point Integration, while straightforward, establishes direct connections between systems, leading to tightly coupled architectures. As more systems are added or changed, this approach does not easily allow for the reuse of components. In the context of modernization and rapid development, reusability can be a significant asset. Option A is incorrect. EDA focuses on producing, detecting, and reacting to events, which can enhance flexibility and scalability. Option C is incorrect. API-led Connectivity emphasizes the reuse of components, which is ideal for rapid and flexible development. Option D is incorrect. Microservices Architecture breaks down applications into small services that run independently, promoting flexibility and reusability.
Question 39
FitTrek, a fitness app company, wishes to integrate with various wearable device platforms to fetch fitness data and provide a consolidated report to the user. This report will use data like heart rate, steps taken, and calories burned, which may come from different wearables. Which integration use cases best suit the requirement?
Broadcast and Transformation
Correct answer
Aggregation and Transformation
Orchestration and Synchronization
Data Replication and Broadcast
Overall explanation
Correct Answer: B. Aggregation and Transformation For the FitTrek application, data from different wearable platforms needs to be ‘aggregated’ to provide a consolidated report. Also, the data might be in different formats across wearables, requiring ‘transformation’ to ensure consistency. Option A is incorrect. While Transformation is required, Broadcasting (sending the same data to multiple endpoints) is not the primary need here. Option C is incorrect. While Orchestration might be needed to manage the sequence, Synchronization (ensuring data remains consistent across systems) is not the primary requirement. Option D is incorrect. Data Replication (duplicating data from one location to another) and Broadcast are not primary needs for this scenario.
Question 40
During a project review meeting, team members discussed the increasing challenges they faced in meeting business demands with their IT capabilities. The term “IT delivery gap” was introduced. Which of the following best defines the concept of the IT delivery gap?
The amount of time it takes to deliver an IT project
The difference in the versions of software between development and production environments
